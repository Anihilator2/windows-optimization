# Windows Optimization for Gaming

Essential scripts and tools to optimize Windows 10 for high-performance and low-latency gaming. Some scripts are my own, and some are the work of others. Each one has a specific, clearly defined purpose, and unless noted, will work independently of the others.

All scripts must be **Run as Administrator**.

## Disclaimer

These scripts have been tested on Windows 10 v2004. They may or may not work on other versions of Windows. 

- This GitHub is not tech support.
- Use Google before asking questions.
- Never use a script you don't understand.
- Backup your computer before running a script.
- I am not responsible if you break your PC.
